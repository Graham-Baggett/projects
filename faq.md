## What is the Cloud Resume Challenge?

The Cloud Resume Challenge is a hands-on project designed to help you bridge the gap from cloud **certification** to cloud **job**. It incorporates many of the skills that real cloud and DevOps engineers use in their daily work.

## Who can complete the Cloud Resume Challenge?

Short answer: anybody! It's a fun way to level up your cloud skills, even if you're already a professional.

(It's extra impressive coming from people brand-new to cloud, though!)

## How did this get started, and who's behind it?

[Forrest Brazeal](https://forrestbrazeal.com), a cloud engineer and community builder now working at Google Cloud, created the original Cloud Resume Challenge in 2020 as a personal attempt to give back to the community. The challenge was first published at [cloudresumechallenge.dev](cloudresumechallenge.dev), but has now been open-sourced so that more people can use and expand on it.

Additional challenges in this repository includen a link to the name of the contributor(s) who created them.

## Is there a deadline to complete the Cloud Resume Challenge?
Early versions of the challenge had a deadline to receive personal code review from Forrest. While that deadline has passed, you can always submit your projects in [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/2PTwAth) to get reviews from the community.

## I saw there is a book about the Cloud Resume Challenge. Do I need to buy it in order to do the challenge?

The core steps of the Cloud Resume Challenge are always free to access here, and you are welcome to try them on your own. This repository also contains numerous additional challenges you can take on to brush up in specific areas such as cloud security.

The official Cloud Resume Challenge [book](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/book) written by Forrest Brazeal contains numerous tools, tips, and resources to help you complete the challenge more quickly and get hired more easily. Forrest uses proceeds from the book to help fund ongoing investments in the challenge initiative and community.

## Does completing the Cloud Resume Challenge guarantee I will get a job in the cloud?

No. But it has helped [a lot of people](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/halloffame) along that road.

Now, fair warning: you will have to open a large number of browser tabs to figure out the challenge. It will take you quite a few long evenings at the kitchen table. You might reasonably conclude that none of it is worth the dubious reward of having a side project on your resume.

But if you give this project a try and realize that you hate it, or you're just not interested, you'll have learned a valuable lesson about whether or not you really want a career in the cloud -- because **these are the types of problems that real cloud engineers and developers really work on.**

And we believe that if you can, in good faith, complete the Cloud Resume Challenge, **you will already have more useful skills than a lot of people who graduate from university computer science programs.** Specifically: you will understand something about full-stack software development, version control, infrastructure as code, automation, continuous integration and delivery, cloud services and "serverless", application security, and networking. And you'll have learned by doing, because the challenge spec doesn't give you enough instructions to figure any of this out without going down some late-night rabbit holes. Most importantly, you will have demonstrated the number-one skill in a cloud engineer's toolbox: the ability to learn fast and google well.

Those are skills you can take to a job interview.

Good luck!

## Can I complete the Cloud Resume Challenge on Microsoft Azure?
[Yes, you can!](azure/cloud-resume-challenge.md)

## Can I complete the Cloud Resume Challenge on Google Cloud (GCP)?
[Absolutely!](google-cloud/cloud-resume-challenge.md)

## Can I complete the challenge using [different technology X]?

Yes! Feel free to use different cloud providers, DevOps tools, etc -- as long as you have met the end objective described in each step.

## Can I work on the steps in a different order?

Yep. As long as you are doing your own work, there's no wrong way to approach the challenge.

## Can I share my solutions online?

You are encouraged to share your general observations and personal approach to solving the challenge when you write your wrap-up blog post. However, please don't share your Python and Javascript code in the blog. Let's keep the challenge properly challenging for others!
